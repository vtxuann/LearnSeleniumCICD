This repository provides a complete implementation of Selenium automation using C#.
All examples and code snippets are written with modern C# syntax and follow up-to-date Selenium practices.

Explore the following key areas in this codebase:

1. Selenium Basics and Architecture: Get to know the fundamentals and how Selenium is put together.

2. Working with Locators: Learn how to interact with different parts of a webpage using various locator tools.

3. Page Object Model: Understand a smart way to organize your Selenium code for easy maintenance.

4. Assertions in Selenium: Find out how to check if your web application is doing what it's supposed to with assertion libraries like NUnit Assert and FluentAssertions

5. Creating Custom Controls: Explore creating custom controls to better handle tricky web elements. Using C# Extension methods will improve the way we write custom methods in more powerful fashion.

6. Data-Driven Testing: Use data-driven testing to cover a bunch of different scenarios.

7. Wait Mechanism: Understand Implicit wait and Explicit waiting in Selenium

8. Cross-Browser: Understand Cross browser testing to work with different browsers

9. Selenium grid: Working with distributed test with Selenium

10. Reporting: Generate Test report for the complete test execution

11. CI/CD: Understand the way to Continuously Integration and Deploy the Test code

On top of that, this codebase is fully cross-platform—written on Windows but ready to run on Linux and Mac thanks to the versatile support of the latest .NET. 
By working through this project, you’ll develop a solid understanding of Selenium fundamentals — from setup and design patterns to advanced automation techniques and reporting.

Target audience: QA, BA, Devs.
